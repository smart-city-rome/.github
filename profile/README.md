## Repository of codes related to the project "AI solutions for sustainable cities" by Sony CSL - Rome.

The repositories contain codes for image processing, metadata extraction, data analysis and development of a Crossroad risk index for smart monitoring of crossroads through edge-computing devices.
Sony's IMX500 was used during the project and data about a crossroad monitoring was collected thanks to the Rome municipality.

This resource has been developed with partial financial support of PNRR MUR project PE0000013-FAIR.
